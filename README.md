A simple game framework for AI development.

Proposed API overview:

    // up, down, left and right are self-explanatory, actions contains four
    //  different inputs that are game specific, e.g. jump or fire.
    typedef struct input_s {
        float up, down, left, right;
        float actions[4];
    } input_t;

    // A structure generated by the game implementation, the player can't change
    //  any of the values, they're only for information purposes.
    typedef struct game_s {
        int screen_width, screen_height;
        float* screen;
        int32_t score;
        bool game_over;

        // Sends a new input to the game and requests a new state to be written
        //  into <game>.
        void (*_update)(game_t* game, input_t input, void* internal_game_state);
        void* _internal_game_state;
    } game_t;

    void update(game_t* game, input_t input) {
        game->_update(game, input, game->internal_game_state);
    }
